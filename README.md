## Corali Task App

A simple and intuitive task management application built with React, designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently.
Project Description

The Corali Task App is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a straightforward interface for managing tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark existing tasks as complete or incomplete, edit task descriptions, and delete tasks. The application also features filtering capabilities, allowing users to view all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks. This project serves as a foundational example of a modern web application leveraging React's component-based architecture for a dynamic user experience.
